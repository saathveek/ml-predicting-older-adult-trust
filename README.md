This project applies supervised machine learning models to predict older adults’ trust in novel assistive robots. This research was conducted under the guidance of Dr. Samuel Olatunji and Dr. Wendy Rogers as an independent study in the Human Factors and Aging Laboratory at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, between January 2023 and April 2024.

## Project Overview

We explored how factors such as prior technology experience, attitudes toward innovation, and demographics influence trust in assistive robots. The goal was to develop interpretable models that inform the design of technology better suited to the needs of aging populations.

## Motivation

As the global population ages, assistive robots offer significant potential to support independence and quality of life. Understanding what drives trust in these technologies is essential to their successful adoption and inclusive design.

## Methods

- **Data Collection:** Survey responses from adults aged 65+ about their trust in emerging assistive robots.
- **Modeling Techniques:** Lasso Regression and Ridge Regression.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Mean Squared Error (MSE), R² Score, and K-Fold Cross-Validation.

## Key Findings

- Prior familiarity with technology is a strong predictor of trust in assistive robots.
- Interpretable regression models revealed the importance of age, technology usage habits, and openness to innovation.
